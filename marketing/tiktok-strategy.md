4. **Link in bio converts** - Direct path from viral video to revenue

## Content Pillars

## Video Scripts

### SCRIPT 1: The Classic Reveal (Best Performer)

**Hook (0-3 sec):**
"I just found $47 hidden in my Solana wallet that I didn't know existed"

**Body (3-20 sec):**
[Screen recording of wallet scan]
"Every time you trade a memecoin and sell it all, the account stays open holding rent money. I had 89 empty accounts from all my degen trades."

**Payoff (20-30 sec):**
[Show the cleanup + balance increase]
"Took 30 seconds to close them all and get my SOL back. Link in bio if you want to check yours."

**Caption:** "check yours before it's too late 💀 #solana #crypto #memecoins #sol"

---

### SCRIPT 2: The "Things They Don't Tell You" Format

**Hook:**
"Things Solana traders don't know: You're leaving money on the table"

**Body:**
"Every token you've ever traded created an account in your wallet. When you sell 100%, the account stays open. Each one holds about $0.30 in rent. If you've traded 100 memecoins..."

[Calculator on screen: 100 × $0.30 = $30]

"That's $30 just sitting there locked up."

**CTA:**
"I made a free tool to find and recover it. Link in bio."

---

### SCRIPT 3: POV Format

**Text overlay:** "POV: You check how much hidden SOL is in your wallet"

[Screen recording]
- Open tool
- Connect wallet
- Watch count go up: 12... 34... 67... 89 empty accounts
- Show total: 0.18 SOL (~$27)
- Click recover
- Show new balance

**Sound:** Trending sound (money counter, surprised reaction, etc.)

---

### SCRIPT 4: The Challenge

**Hook:**
"Let's see how much hidden SOL YOU have in your wallet"

**Body:**
"Drop your wallet address in the comments and I'll check it live"

[Do 3-4 live checks on stream/video]
"@user1 has 34 accounts = $10 hidden"
"@user2 has 127 accounts = $38 hidden"

**CTA:**
"Or check yourself - link in bio"

*Note: This drives MASSIVE engagement. Comments = algorithm boost.*

---

### SCRIPT 5: Storytime + Screen Record

**Hook:**
"I mass aped into 200 memecoins last month. Here's what happened to my wallet."

**Body:**
"So I was checking my wallet and noticed I had like no SOL left even though I hadn't traded in a week. Turns out every single trade created these empty accounts that were holding my rent money hostage."

[Show the scan]

"I had 187 empty accounts. That's like $56 just gone."

[Show recovery]

"Closed them all in like 30 seconds. Free money."

---

### SCRIPT 6: Duet/Stitch Bait

Find videos of people:
- Complaining about losing money on memecoins
- Showing big memecoin portfolios
- "I'm down bad" content

**Stitch with:**
"At least recover some of that - you probably have $20-50 in hidden rent from all those trades"

[Show your tool]

---

### SCRIPT 7: The "Why" Educational

**Hook:**
"Why does Solana charge rent? Let me explain"

**Body:**
"Solana makes you pay rent to store data on the blockchain. When you create a token account, you pay about 0.002 SOL upfront. This is supposed to be refundable when you close the account, but..."

"Most wallets don't close accounts automatically. So every memecoin you've ever touched? Still there. Still holding your money."

**CTA:**
"I'll show you how to get it back - follow for part 2"

---

## Hooks That Work (Rotate These)

### Curiosity Gap
- "There's hidden SOL in your wallet and you don't even know it"
- "The reason you're always low on SOL isn't what you think"
- "Solana has a feature that's stealing your money"

### Specific Numbers
- "I found $47 hidden in my wallet"
- "89 empty accounts = 0.18 SOL recovered"
- "If you've traded 50+ memecoins, you probably have $15+ stuck"

### Direct Call Out
- "Memecoin traders need to see this"
- "If you trade on Solana, check this immediately"
- "POV: You've traded memecoins and don't know about rent"

### Urgency (use sparingly)
- "Check yours before SOL pumps more"
- "This took me 30 seconds and I got $40 back"

---

This drives engagement which boosts the video.

### 2. Reply to Every Comment
TikTok rewards this heavily. Even just "🔥" counts.

### 3. Go Live
Once you hit 1k followers, go live checking people's wallets.
"Drop address in chat, I'll check live"
Insane engagement + direct conversions.

### 4. Duet Chain
Find someone's video about losing money on memecoins.
Stitch it: "at least get some back"
They might duet your video → viral chain.

### 5. Before/After Format
Show wallet before: 0.5 SOL
Run tool
Show wallet after: 0.67 SOL
Simple. Effective. Shareable.
