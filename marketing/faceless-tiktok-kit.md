## SCRIPT A: The Classic Demo (30s) ⭐ START HERE

### Voiceover Script (copy into ElevenLabs)

```
Solana wallets: you probably have stuck SOL.

Every memecoin you've traded created a token account. When you sold, the account stayed open, holding rent.

We scan your wallet, find empty accounts, and close them. Non-custodial - you sign every transaction.

This wallet had 47 empty accounts. That's point one eight SOL just sitting there.

Tap clean up. Approve once. SOL returns to your wallet.

Free scan. Link in bio. Not financial advice.
```

## SCRIPT C: The Explainer (25s)

### Voiceover Script

```
What are empty token accounts and why do they cost you SOL?

Every time you buy a token on Solana, your wallet creates a new account to hold it. That account costs about point zero zero two SOL in rent.

When you sell everything, the account stays open. The rent stays locked.

If you've traded a hundred tokens, that's point two SOL - about thirty dollars - just sitting there.

This tool finds and closes them. You sign. You keep the SOL minus a small fee.

## SCRIPT E: Objection Handler - "Is This Safe?" (20s)

### Voiceover Script

```
Is this tool safe? Let me show you.

We never touch your private keys. You connect your wallet just like any dapp.

When you clean up, YOU sign every transaction in your own wallet. We can't move anything without your approval.

The fee comes from the recovered SOL - you only pay if it works.

Non-custodial. Transparent. Check it yourself.

Link in bio.

## AI Voice Settings

### ElevenLabs Recommended Settings

```
Voice: "Adam" or "Antoni" (natural male)
        "Rachel" or "Bella" (natural female)
        
Stability: 0.5 (balanced)
Clarity: 0.75 (clear but not robotic)
Style: 0 (neutral)

Speed: Normal or slightly slow (0.9x if option exists)
```

### CapCut TTS Alternative

```
Voice: "Alex" (male) or "Emma" (female)
Speed: Normal
Pitch: Default

Note: CapCut TTS is faster but less natural
ElevenLabs is better quality but requires export/import
```

### Voice Script Tips

- Use periods for pauses
- Write "point one eight" not "0.18" (clearer speech)
- Keep sentences short
- End with downward inflection (sounds confident)

---

## CapCut Editing Workflow

### Step 1: Import Screen Recording
- Record at 1080x1920 (vertical)
- Include full flow: connect → scan → results → cleanup → success

### Step 2: Add AI Voiceover
- Option A: Generate in ElevenLabs → import audio
- Option B: Use CapCut's built-in TTS

### Step 3: Cut to Match Audio
- Align screen actions with voiceover beats
- Use J-cuts (audio leads video slightly)

### Step 4: Add Text Overlays
- Use CapCut "Auto Captions" for the voiceover
- Add manual overlays for key moments:
  - Hook text (0-3s) - BIG, bold
  - Stats ("47 accounts", "0.18 SOL")
  - CTA ("link in bio")

### Step 5: Add Sound Effects
- CapCut has free SFX library
- Use sparingly:
  - Notification ding (hook)
  - Cash register (when showing SOL amount)
  - Success chime (when cleanup completes)

### Step 6: Add Badges/Trust Elements
- Create in Canva or use CapCut stickers:
  - "Non-custodial"
  - "You Sign Everything"
  - "No Seed Phrases"

### Step 7: Export
- 1080x1920
- 30fps
- High quality
- Direct upload to TikTok

## Batch Production Method

### Record Once, Make 5 Videos

1. **Record 3 different wallet cleanups** (vary the amounts)
2. **Cut each into:**
   - Full 30s demo
   - Quick 15s highlight
   - Specific moment clip (just the results reveal)
3. **Remix with different:**
   - Voiceovers (male/female)
   - Hooks (swap first 3 seconds)
   - Music/sounds

### Example Batch Day

```
Morning (1 hour):
- Record 3 wallet cleanups (15 min each)
- Export raw footage

Afternoon (2 hours):
- Script A: Full demo × 3 wallets = 3 videos
- Script B: Quick cut × 3 wallets = 3 videos
- Script D: Results focus × 3 wallets = 3 videos

Total: 9 videos from 3 recordings
Post: 1-2 per day for the week
```
