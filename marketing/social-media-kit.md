## Twitter/X Threads

### Thread 1: The Problem

```
🧵 You're probably leaving $20-50 in your Solana wallet without knowing it.

Here's how to get it back (30 seconds):
```

```
Every time you trade a memecoin, Solana creates a "token account" in your wallet.

When you sell 100% of that token, the account stays open.

Each one holds ~0.002 SOL in "rent" - about $0.30.
```

```
If you've traded 100 memecoins (and let's be honest, we all have), that's:

100 accounts × $0.30 = $30 trapped

For heavy traders: 300+ accounts = $90+
```

```
The fix takes 30 seconds:

1. Connect wallet
2. Scan for empty accounts
3. Close them all in one click
4. SOL returned instantly

I built a tool that does exactly this: [link]
```

```
It's 100% non-custodial - your keys never leave your wallet.

You just sign the "close account" transactions and the rent flows back to you.

```

### Thread 2: Results Showcase

```
Just helped someone recover 0.23 SOL (~$35) from their wallet.

They had 112 empty token accounts from memecoin trading.

Took 45 seconds to close them all.

Here's the before/after 🧵
```

[Screenshot before]
[Screenshot after]

```
This happens because Solana charges "rent" to store data.

Token accounts cost ~0.002 SOL each.

When you sell a token completely, the account stays open holding that rent hostage.
```

```
Most people have 50-200+ of these accounts sitting there.

That's $15-60 just... gone.

Unless you close them.
```

```
Built a tool to find and close them automatically:

→ Free to scan
→ Non-custodial
→ 30 seconds

## Influencer Outreach Template

### DM Template (Cold)
```
Hey [name]! 

Quick question - do you know about the hidden SOL sitting in your wallet from old trades?

I built a tool that finds and recovers it. Would love to check your wallet live on a video if you're down - most traders have $20-50+ stuck.

Lmk if interested 🤙
```

### Collaboration Pitch
```
Hey [name],

Love your Solana content. Got a collab idea:

I built RentReclaim - finds hidden SOL from empty token accounts. Most active traders have $30-100+ trapped.

Thinking we could do:
- You check your wallet live
- Show viewers how much you recover
- Split the vid on both channels

Happy to set you up with a custom ref link (20% of fees from your audience).

Down?
```

### Partner Program Pitch
```
Hey [name],

Running a partner program for Solana creators:

→ 20% rev share on all cleanups from your audience
→ Custom referral link with your branding  
→ Real-time dashboard showing earnings
→ Weekly payouts in SOL

Average creator earning: 2-5 SOL/month

Want in? Reply and I'll set you up.
```
