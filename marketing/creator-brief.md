## Example Scripts (Ready to Use)

### Script 1: Classic Demo

"Solana users - you probably have stuck SOL in your wallet.

*[show scan results]*

Every memecoin creates a token account. When you sell, the account stays open holding rent.

I had 47 empty accounts. That's point one eight SOL just sitting there.

*[show cleanup]*

One click, approve in Phantom, done.

Non-custodial - you sign everything.

Free scan, link in bio. Not financial advice."

---

### Script 2: Quick React

*[show scan starting]*

"Let's see how much stuck SOL is in my wallet..."

*[results pop up]*

"Wait... 63 empty accounts?! That's like twenty bucks!"

*[cleanup running]*

"This takes thirty seconds..."

*[success]*

"Done. Point one nine SOL back."

"Link in bio if you wanna check yours. NFA."

---

### Script 3: Explainer

"Why does your SOL keep disappearing?

Here's what no one tells you:

Every token you buy creates a new account.
Each account costs point zero zero two SOL in rent.
When you sell, the account stays open.
The rent stays locked.

If you've traded 100 memecoins, that's like 30 bucks stuck.

This tool finds them and closes them.
You sign everything. Non-custodial.

Link in bio. NFA."
